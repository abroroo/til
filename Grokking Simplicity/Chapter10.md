# Chapter 10: First-Class Functions

In this chapter, the concept of "first-class functions" is introduced. The idea is that functions in programming aren't just limited to one specific use. Unlike variables that are only for storing values, or loops that follow a particular structure, functions are incredibly versatile.

### What Can First-Class Functions Do?

- **Assigned to variables:** You can store functions in variables, just like any other value.
- **Passed as arguments:** Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, which opens up a lot of flexibility.
- **Returned from other functions:** A function can return another function, making it easy to create flexible and reusable code.
- **Stored in data structures:** Functions can be stored in arrays, objects, or other data structures, just like any other data type.

### Making Implicit Arguments Explicit

Sometimes, you might find different functions that are almost identical except for their names. These functions have what's called "implicit arguments." Instead of having multiple similar functions, you can create one general function and pass in the varying parts as explicit arguments. This makes your code more reusable and easier to manage.

**Simplified Version:**  
Imagine having several functions with slightly different names but the same core logic. Instead of keeping them all, you can refactor them into a single function that takes an extra argument to handle those differences.
