## Chapter 2

Another way to look at this is by keeping **actions, calculations, and data separate from each other. This is called layering**. By putting actions into their own layers, we can limit how much they mess with other parts of the system.

Think of it like making a pizza, as Toni does in the example. You have your ingedients (data), make sauce and toppings (calculations), and the make the dough and bake it (actions). You keep each part separate and combine them to the next layer only if it is finished. 

By layering these parts:
- **Data (Base)**: Keep it consistent and accessible.
- **Calculations (Sauce and Toppings)**: Prepare them so they always turn out the same.
- **Actions (Baking)**: Do this last to bring everything together, ensuring nothing unexpected happens during the process.

Layering helps make sure each part does its job without causing problems for the others. This makes the system more stable and easier to manage.
