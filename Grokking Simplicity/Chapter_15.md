# Chapter 15 : Timelines

The code can be put into a diagrom of timelines to see how each function(action types only) gets called. 

This is how **Syncronyous** code timeline:

This is how **Asynchronuous** code timeline would look like:

### Improtant to note that!

In a sequential program, instructions usually execute one after the other, in a single straight line.
However, if two sequences of code (like two threads) are running concurrently, the instructions from these sequences might get "interleaved," meaning that a few instructions from one sequence might execute, then a few from another, and so on.
