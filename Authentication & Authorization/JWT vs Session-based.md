The main difference lies in where the authentication information is stored:

 - With __JWT authentication__, the authentication information is stored in the token itself, which is typically stored on the client side (e.g., in memory or local storage).
 - With __session-based authentication__, the session ID is stored in the cookie on the client side, while the authentication information (e.g., user ID, authentication status) is stored on the server side, often in a session store like Redis.
