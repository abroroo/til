Recoil is a more simplified state managment tool (similar to Redux but much simpler to work with).

Unlike Redux, which has a centralized store to manage application state, Recoil doesn't have a general store. Instead, Recoil manages state in a more decentralized manner using atoms and selectors.

It has a [Selectors](https://recoiljs.org/docs/basic-tutorial/selectors) concept which by far is just like reducers in Redux
