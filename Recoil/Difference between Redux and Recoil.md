# How Recoil differs from Redux: 

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts) are two common tools for managing state in UI frameworks. Although they do similar jobs, they work differently.

Redux has a central store where all application state lives(single source of truth for application state). In contrast, Recoil doesn't have a central store. Instead, it manages state in a more decentralized manner using atoms and selectors.

## __In Recoil:__

- __Atoms__: Atoms are units of state that represent individual pieces of data in your application. Each atom handles a specific part of your app's data, like user info or settings.

- __Selectors__: Selectors are used to derive state based on the current state of atoms. They let you calculate new values or change existing states without directly editing them.

Recoil provides hooks like `useRecoilState()` and `useRecoilValue()` to interact with atoms and selectors in your components. These hooks make it easy to read and update state without needing a central storage spot.




## IMO: Recoil seems simpler to use for a couple of reasons:

1. __Automatic updates and minimal boilerplate code:__ Recoil manages state updates by automatically re-evaluating selectors and components when atoms' values change.
   
2. __More Flexible and Easier:__ Each atom and selector manages its own piece of state, making it easier to understand and manage.
