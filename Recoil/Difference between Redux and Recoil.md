## How Recoil differs from Redux: 

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts) are two common tools for managing state in UI frameworks. Although they do similar jobs, they work differently.

Redux has a central store where all application state lives. In contrast, Recoil doesn't have a central store. Instead, it manages state in a more decentralized manner using atoms and selectors.

### __In Recoil:__

- __Atoms__: Atoms are units of state that represent individual pieces of data in your application. Each atom handles a specific part of your app's data, like user info or settings.

- __Selectors__: Selectors are used to figure out data based on what's in the atoms. They let you calculate new values or change existing ones without directly editing them.

Recoil provides hooks like `useRecoilState()` and `useRecoilValue()` to interact with atoms and selectors in your components. These hooks make it easy to read and update state without needing a central storage spot.

### In My Humble Opinion (IMHO): Recoil's approach seems a lot easier to work with. Here's why: 

1. __Automatic updates and minimal boilerplate code:__ Recoil keeps track of changes and updates things as needed, saving you from writing a bunch of extra code.

2. __More Flexible and Easier:__ Recoil's setup is simpler and more flexible. Each atom and selector handles its own bit of data, making it easier to understand and manage.
