# What is `hosts` file?

Before creation of DNS(Domain Name System) ,when internet had around 5000-10000 users, computers used `hosts` file to store names for different ip addresses. 

Now since there are billions users on internet, it became obsolete. But computers still keep `hosts` file. For Mac/Linux systems it is in `/etc/hosts` directory.           

__It is very convenient when it comes to using it as a list of shortcuts for your favorite websites__.

For example, you can just add `ip addresses` of your favorite websites with a shortcut text to your computer's `hosts` file

> A Linux/Mac computer keeps `hosts` file in `/etc/hosts` directory.

__How it works:__ when router recognizes the domain name that is on the list of hosts file, it will redirect it to origin. 

If you want to use the hosts file from that website, itâ€™s super simple:
```bash
$ wget someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts
$ sudo cat hosts >> /etc/hosts
$ rm hosts
```
