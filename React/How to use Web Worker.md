# What's Web Worker: 
A [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) is a browser feature where you can run, some computation or additional scripts, separately from the main execution thread where the web page is running.

Web workers have their own event loop, separate from the main JavaScript event loop. This means that they have their own call stack, microtask queue, and callback queue, allowing them to operate independently without interfering with the main thread's event loop.

- They operate in a separate thread and have no access to the main thread's resources like the DOM, Window object, or other Web APIs.
- Communication between the main thread and the worker is done via a messaging system using the __`postMessage`__ and __`onmessage`__ events.

# How to use Web Worker in React: 

 1. Create a new file for the Web Worker, let's call it worker.js. This file will contain the logic that you want to run in a separate thread:
```javascript
  // worker.js
self.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  // Receive data from the main thread
  const data = event.data;

  // Perform some computationally intensive task
  const result = computeIntensiveTask(data);

  // Send the result back to the main thread
  self.postMessage(result);
});

function computeIntensiveTask(data) {
  // Perform some long-running or computationally intensive task
  // ...
  // Return the result
  return result;
}

   ```
2. In your React component, you can create and use the Web Worker like this:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);
  const [worker, setWorker] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create a new Web Worker instance
    const newWorker = new Worker('./worker.js');

    // Set up event listeners for communication
    newWorker.onmessage = (event) => {
      // Receive the result from the worker
      setResult(event.data);
    };

    // Store the worker instance in state
    setWorker(newWorker);

    // Clean up the worker when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      newWorker.terminate();
    };
  }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Send data to the worker
    worker.postMessage('some data');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Start Intensive Task</button>
      <p>Result: {result}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;

```
When you click the button, the data is sent to the worker thread, which performs the computationally intensive task and sends the result back to the main thread. The result is then updated in the component's state and displayed.
