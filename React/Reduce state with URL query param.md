## Keeping Persistnat Filters on lists with URL 

I've read a interseting article about using page URL to have persistant filters on the lists. I use lists often at my work, so this method of keeping lists persitent seems really a good approach. I'd recommend to read the [article](https://buildui.com/posts/how-to-control-a-react-component-with-the-url).

Here is a my take on it:

When have a list with filters, and you want to keep active filters even if user refreshes the page or shares the link.

In React, we often do it using "state." But if the page reloads, this state resets, and we forget which filters were applied.

To fix this, we can use the URL (the web address) to remember the state.

#### Here's how we can do it:

  - Instead of using React state for filters, we put them in the URL.
  
  - When the page loads, we read filters from the URL so the right data is shown.
  
  - Now, filters stay even after a refresh, and we can share the link with the same filtered results.
  
  
  This also reduces unnecessary re-renders since weâ€™re not relying on React state.

#### For example 

#### Loses filters on refresh:

```typescript

export default function Page() {
  let [search, setSearch] = useState('');

  let { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['people', search],
    queryFn: async () => {
      let res = await fetch(`/api/people?search=${search}`);
      return res.json();
    },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <Input
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Find someone..."
      />
      {/* Render list */}
    </>
  );
}


```
Here, when we refresh, the search disappears because state resets.


#### Filters persist after refresh:

```typescript

export default function Home() {
  let searchParams = useSearchParams();
  let search = searchParams.get('search') ?? '';

  let { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['people', search],
    queryFn: async () => {
      let res = await fetch(`/api/people?search=${search}`);
      return res.json();
    },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <Input
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => {
          let search = e.target.value;
          router.push(`${pathname}?search=${search}`);
        }}
        placeholder="Find someone..."
      />
      {/* Render list */}
    </>
  );
}


```
Now, the search text stays in the URL, so even after a refresh, we see the same filtered list

It's also useful for the browser's **back and forward buttons**. If we click on a list item and navigate to its details, pressing the **back button** will return us to the filtered list with the last search still applied.
