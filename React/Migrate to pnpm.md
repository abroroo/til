## 🛠️ Understanding pnpm – How It Works (Compared to npm)

### 1️⃣ Package Storage – Global Store
- **npm:** Each project has its own `node_modules`, storing full copies of packages.
- **pnpm:** Packages are stored **once** in a global **content-addressable store** on your machine.
- Path (Linux/macOS): `~/.pnpm-store`
- Path (Windows): `%APPDATA%/pnpm/store`

- Every project **links to this global store** instead of downloading and copying packages every time.

- 📌 **Result:** Faster installs, less disk usage across projects.

---

### 2️⃣ Dependency Linking – Symlink Structure
- **npm:** Directly puts packages inside `node_modules`, often hoisting shared packages to the root.
- **pnpm:** Uses **symlinks**.
    - Each project’s `node_modules` contains **symlinks pointing to the global store**.
    - Each dependency gets its **own fully isolated folder (no accidental sharing)**.
    - Example:
        ```
        node_modules/
        ├── lodash -> .pnpm/lodash@4.17.21/node_modules/lodash
        ```
    - The actual `lodash` lives in the global store, not directly inside the project.

- 📌 **Result:** 
    - Guaranteed correct version per package.
    - No "phantom dependencies" (packages using wrong versions by accident).

---

### 3️⃣ Version Isolation – No Hoisting Conflicts
- **npm:** Tries to "hoist" shared dependencies to the top-level `node_modules`, which can result in:
    - **Silent version mismatches** (package asks for v1, gets v2 because v2 was hoisted).
    - Harder-to-debug dependency issues.
- **pnpm:** Every package gets exactly **what’s listed in its package.json**.
    - No cross-contamination.
    - Hoisting is minimal, and only for things that are absolutely safe (like types or tools).

- 📌 **Result:** Predictable, reliable dependency resolution.

---

### 4️⃣ Lockfile – Cleaner & More Accurate
- **npm:** Uses `package-lock.json` (flat structure).
- **pnpm:** Uses `pnpm-lock.yaml` (more compact, easier to diff, better tracking of nested dependencies).

- 📌 **Result:** Easier reviews and debugging lockfile issues.

---

### 5️⃣ Monorepo Handling
- **npm workspaces:** Works, but still does a lot of redundant downloading and hoisting.
- **pnpm workspaces:** 
    - One central store for all packages across workspaces.
    - Internal packages (like shared UI libs) are automatically linked.
    - Faster, better package sharing between workspaces.

- 📌 **Result:** Real space and time savings for projects with shared internal packages.

## 📝 Migration Guide – How to Switch a Project from npm to pnpm

1. **Remove node_modules and package-lock.json** (optional, you can keep package-lock.json if you want pnpm to import it).
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    ```

2. **Run pnpm import** (if you kept package-lock.json, it converts it to pnpm-lock.yaml):
    ```bash
    pnpm import
    ```

3. **Run pnpm install** to create `node_modules` using pnpm’s symlink system:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4. **Replace npm commands with pnpm** (in CI/CD or scripts if needed):
    - `npm run start` → `pnpm run start`
    - `npm install` → `pnpm install`

5. **(Optional)** Delete package-lock.json after migration (pnpm uses pnpm-lock.yaml).

### ✅ Example Script Change (package.json)

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "pnpm run build && pnpm run dev"
}
```

---

### Final Note
pnpm works **faster, uses less disk space, prevents version mismatches, and handles monorepos better** — but the key difference is how it uses:
- **Global store instead of per-project downloads.**
- **Symlinks instead of direct copies.**
- **Strict dependency isolation per package.**
