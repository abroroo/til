Web Audio API is very cool api that helps to create and manipulate audio in web applications. I've tried it with Audio Visualization, here is a good [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API) on how to do it!

### Key Components of [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API):
#### [AudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext):

The core of the Web Audio API is the `AudioContext` interface.
It's the main container or environment where you create, process, and manage audio nodes (sources, effects, etc.).

#### Audio Nodes:

[AudioNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode) are building blocks that you connect together to create an audio processing graph within the AudioContext.

* There are different types of nodes:
  * Source Nodes: Generate audio (e.g., `AudioBufferSourceNode` for playing pre-recorded audio or `OscillatorNode` for generating tones).
  * Processing Nodes: Modify or process audio (e.g., `GainNode` for volume control, `BiquadFilterNode` for filtering).
  * Destination Node: Represents the final output (usually the speakers or headphones).

 ### How to Use Web Audio API

1. Creating an AudioContext:
   
    ```
    const audioContext = new AudioContext();
    ```
 2. Loading and Playing Audio:

    ```
    // Fetch an audio file or create an AudioBuffer
    fetch('path/to/audio-file.mp3')
    .then(response => response.arrayBuffer())
    .then(arrayBuffer => audioContext.decodeAudioData(arrayBuffer))
    .then(audioBuffer => {
      const source = audioContext.createBufferSource();
      source.buffer = audioBuffer;
      source.connect(audioContext.destination);
      source.start();
    });
    ```
3. Applying Effects and Processing:

   ```
    // Create nodes and connect them for audio processing
      const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
      const gainNode = audioContext.createGain();
      
      oscillator.connect(gainNode);
      gainNode.connect(audioContext.destination);
      
      oscillator.start();
      
      // Adjust volume using GainNode
      gainNode.gain.value = 0.5; // Set volume to 50%


   ```
    
There are many things you can try with it. 
I've tried it with Audio Visualization, but there are way more use cases like games, music applications, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) and more.
