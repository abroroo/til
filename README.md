# TIL 
> Today I Learned

Collection of things I learned as a developer

Concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. Keeping track of them helps me retain more and makes it easier to share the knowledge with other devs that can benefit from it. 

I love to learn so please let me know if you spot any mistakes or I missed something. Feel free to share anything you find useful.

This repo is inspired by the [@/drecali/til](https://github.com/drecali/til) repo and the concept of `Learning in Public`
