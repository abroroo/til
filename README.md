# til [Today I Learned]
Collection of things I learned as a developer

A collection of the most useful things I learned as a developer (not added in the order I learned them). Keeping track of them helps me retain more and makes it easier to share the knowledge with other devs that can benefit from it. I love to learn so please let me know if you spot any mistakes or I missed something. Feel free to share anything you find useful.

This repo is inspired by the [@/drecali/til](https://github.com/drecali/til) repo and the Learning in Public idea/movement.
