#### What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It lets you describe the services that make up your app in a YAML file, and then provides a convenient way to start, stop, and scale them. Think of it as a way to glue Docker containers together to form a larger application.
